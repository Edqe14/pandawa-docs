# Routes

By design, Pandawa takes care most of the handling of any routes. It leverages the route configuration using YAML files to simplify the creation of a route, for example:

```yaml
# Api/Resources/routes/routes.yaml
products:
  type: group
  children: _product.yaml

# Api/Resources/routes/_product.yaml
products:
  type: resource
  path: products
  rules: [manage_product]
```

## Types

There is some core types for different purposes to define a route.

### `group`

This type is self-explanatory, it groups different routes together. This type usually is used for a specific route group or route children.

<Example>

```yaml
products:
  type: group
  children: _product.yaml
```

</Example>

### `resource`

This acts the same like Laravel's resource controller. You don't have to write your implementation yourself since Pandawa already did the hard-lifting.

<Example>

```yaml
products:
  type: resource
  path: products
```

</Example>

### `message`

This one is little bit complex and different from the rest. This type will refer an handler *(command/query/etc.)* and invoke it.

<Example>

```yaml
create_product:
  type: message
  message: create-product
  path: products
  methods: [post]
```

</Example>

**[Read more](./message)**

### `presenter`

As for this one, it's the same as route handler you usually do in vanilla Laravel. You'll have to manually write the route implementation and things. It's all in your hand...

<Example>

```yaml
product_image:
  type: presenter
  presenter: image
  path: products/{product}/image
  methods: [get]
```

</Example>

## Validation

Declaring a rule is easy as smashing a cardboard wall ðŸ˜ƒ

### Declaring a rule

1. Make a YAML file in `Resources/rules` of any folder inside your app `src`.
2. Using the following template, feel free to fill it to your use-case.

  ```yaml
  rule_name:
    constraints:
      key: "required|string"
      key2: "required|integer"
  ```

  Constraints values are the same as Laravel's validation types. This doesn't only apply to the request body but also includes URL parameter, query, etc.

### Using the rule

All you need to add a single line to your route configuration

```yaml
rules: [rule_name]
```

<Example>

```yaml
create_product:
  type: message
  message: create-product
  path: products
  methods: [post]
  # highlight-next-line
  rules: [manage_product]
```

</Example>

## Middleware

Using middlewares in Pandawa is also a piece of cake. All you need to do is make the middleware implementation exactly the same as vanilla Laravel middleware and register it at `app/laravel/Http/Kernel.php`, in the `$routeMiddleware` option.

<Example>

```php
// app/laravel/Http/Kernel.php

// ...
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ...
    'roles.has'   => \Pandawa\Api\Http\Middleware\HasRole::class,
];
```

</Example>

### Using the middleware

All you need to add a single line to your route configuration like [rules](#using-the-rule)

```yaml
middlewares: [middleware_name]
```

<Example>

```yaml
create_product:
  type: message
  message: create-product
  path: products
  methods: [post]
  rules: [manage_product]
  # highlight-next-line
  middlewares: ["roles.has:admin"]
```

</Example>
